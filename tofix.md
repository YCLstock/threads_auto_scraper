[23:31:54.562] ./src/components/Dashboard.tsx:73:21
[23:31:54.562] Type error: Conversion of type '{ metadata: { generated_at: string; data_range: { start_date: string; end_date: string; }; total_posts: number; total_users: number; total_interactions: number; }; heat_bubble_data: { post_id: string; ... 12 more ...; color: string; }[]; keyword_trends_data: { ...; }[]; topic_treemap_data: { ...; }[]; dashboard_stat...' to type 'DashboardData' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
[23:31:54.563]   Types of property 'dashboard_stats' are incompatible.
[23:31:54.564]     Type '{ top_trending_topics: { name: string; growth_rate: number; posts_today: number; }[]; top_users: { username: string; total_interactions: number; posts_count: number; avg_engagement: number; }[]; engagement_summary: { ...; }; time_analysis: { ...; }; }' is not comparable to type 'DashboardStats & { top_trending_topics: { name: string; growth_rate: number; posts_today: number; }[]; top_users: { username: string; total_interactions: number; posts_count: number; }[]; }'.
[23:31:54.565]       Type '{ top_trending_topics: { name: string; growth_rate: number; posts_today: number; }[]; top_users: { username: string; total_interactions: number; posts_count: number; avg_engagement: number; }[]; engagement_summary: { ...; }; time_analysis: { ...; }; }' is missing the following properties from type 'DashboardStats': total_posts, total_interactions, active_topics, trending_keywords, and 3 more.
